# Software Design

## Overview

WEC-Grid is designed as a modular framework for integrating wave energy converter (WEC) models into power system simulations. The software architecture follows object-oriented principles with clear separation of concerns between different components.

## System Architecture

[Include your UML diagrams and flowcharts here]

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each component has a specific responsibility
- **Extensibility**: New power system backends and WEC models can be easily added
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration between WEC-Sim and power system tools
- **Data Persistence**: Centralized database for simulation results and configuration

## Component Interaction
