# Software Design

WEC-Grid follows a modular architecture with clear separation between marine energy and power system domains.

## Design Principles

- **Bridge Pattern**: Unified interface across different power system backends
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between WEC modeling and power system analysis
- **Extensibility**: Easy integration of new models and backends
- **Data Persistence**: Centralized SQLite database for reproducible research


### Engine
Central coordinator managing simulation workflow and component interaction.

### Power System Modelers  
Standardized interface for PSSÂ®E and PyPSA backends with consistent data formats.

### WEC Modeling
Device and farm-level modeling with integration to WEC-Sim for high-fidelity simulation.

### Data Management
SQLite database with structured storage for simulation metadata and time-series results.
