# WEC-Grid

**WEC-Grid** is a Python package for integrating **Wave Energy Converter (WEC)** models with power system simulation tools such as **PSS®E** and **PyPSA**.  
It supports hydrodynamic WEC modeling via **WEC-Sim**, standardized data handling, visualization, and reproducible simulation workflows.

---

## Features

- **Multi-platform grid simulation** — i.e PSS®E and PyPSA.
- **Hydrodynamic modeling** with MATLAB-based WEC-Sim.
- **Standardized data APIs** for bus, generator, and load data.
- **Built-in example models** — IEEE test systems and RM3 WEC model.
- **Integrated database support** for simulation results.
- **Visualization tools** for time series and network plots.
