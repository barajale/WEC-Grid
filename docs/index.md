# WEC-Grid

**WEC-Grid** is a Python framework for integrating **Wave Energy Converter (WEC)** models with power system simulation tools. It bridges the gap between device-level hydrodynamic modeling and grid-scale power system analysis.

## What is WEC-Grid?

WEC-Grid enables researchers and engineers to:

- **Model wave energy systems** at both device and grid scales
- **Integrate WEC farms** into existing power system models
- **Analyze grid impacts** of wave energy deployment
- **Perform co-simulation** between WEC-Sim and power system tools

## Key Features

### ðŸŒŠ **Wave Energy Modeling**
- Integration with MATLAB WEC-Sim for device-level physics
- Support for validated WEC models (RM3, LUPA)
- Scalable from single devices to large arrays

### âš¡ **Power System Integration**
- Compatible with PSSÂ®E and PyPSA backends
- IEEE standard test systems included
- Grid connection and control modeling

### ðŸ“Š **Data Management**
- SQLite database for simulation results
- Standardized data APIs for reproducible workflows
- Built-in visualization and plotting tools

### ðŸ”§ **Workflow Support**
- Time-synchronized co-simulation
- Automated result collection and storage
- Extensible architecture for new models

## Why WEC-Grid?

Traditional wave energy studies often focus on either device-level performance or grid-level impacts in isolation. WEC-Grid provides the missing link, enabling:

- **Comprehensive analysis** of wave energy integration scenarios
- **Realistic modeling** of both resource variability and grid constraints  
- **Standardized workflows** for comparative studies
- **Open-source platform** for collaborative research
