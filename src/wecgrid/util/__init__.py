"""Helper utilities for time management and database access.

This package collects small helpers used throughout :mod:`wecgrid` to keep
core modules focused on simulation logic.  It currently exposes
``WECGridTime`` for time-related operations and ``WECGridDB`` for interacting
with the project database.

Usage Notes
-----------
The utilities are lightweight and may evolve as the project grows. Prefer
using ``WECGridTime`` over direct ``datetime`` manipulation to ensure
consistent time-zone handling, and ``WECGridDB`` for simple database tasks.
