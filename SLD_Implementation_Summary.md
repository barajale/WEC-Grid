# GridState-Based Single Line Diagram (SLD) Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Single Line Diagram generator for WEC-GRID that works with the unified GridState data structure, supporting both PSS®E and PyPSA backends.

## What's Available in GridState

### ✅ Available Data for SLD:
- **Buses**: Numbers, names, types (Slack/PV/PQ), voltage levels
- **Lines**: From/to bus connections, loading percentages, status
- **Generators**: Connected bus numbers, power output, status
- **Loads**: Connected bus numbers, power consumption, status

### ❌ Missing Data:
- **Transformers**: Not identified separately in GridState schema
- **Geographical Positions**: Calculated algorithmically using NetworkX
- **Shunt Devices**: Not included in current component schema
- **Line Impedances**: Not stored in GridState (only loading %)

## Implementation Details

### Key Features:
1. **Unified Interface**: Works with both PSS®E and PyPSA using same GridState data
2. **Automatic Layout**: Uses NetworkX Kamada-Kawai algorithm for bus positioning
3. **Component Visualization**:
   - Buses: Colored rectangles (Slack=red, PV=green, PQ=gray)
   - Lines: Black lines connecting buses
   - Generators: Circles with 'G' symbol above buses
   - Loads: Downward arrows on buses
4. **Interactive Legend**: Clear component identification
5. **Flexible Output**: Optional saving to file

### Usage:
```python
from wecgrid.plot.plot import WECGridPlot

# Create plotter instance
plotter = WECGridPlot(engine)

# Generate SLD for PSS®E backend
plotter.sld("psse")

# Generate SLD for PyPSA backend  
plotter.sld("pypsa")

# Save SLD to file
plotter.sld("psse", save_path="my_sld.png", title="Custom Title")
```

## Comparison with Original Implementation

### Original PSS®E-only SLD:
- ✅ Direct PSS®E API access
- ✅ Transformer identification
- ✅ Complex connection routing
- ❌ PSS®E-only (no PyPSA support)
- ❌ Hardcoded for PSS®E data structures

### New GridState-based SLD:
- ✅ Universal backend support (PSS®E + PyPSA)
- ✅ Clean, standardized data interface
- ✅ Simplified but effective visualization
- ❌ No transformer identification
- ❌ Simplified connection routing
- ✅ Easier to maintain and extend

## Recommendations

### For Current Use:
The GridState-based SLD is ready for production use and provides:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Clean, informative diagrams
- All essential power system components
- Easy integration with existing WEC-GRID workflows

### For Future Enhancement:
1. **Add Transformer Data to GridState Schema**:
   ```python
   # Potential schema addition
   transformer: pd.DataFrame = field(default_factory=lambda: pd.DataFrame())
   # Columns: xfmr, xfmr_name, ibus, jbus, tap_ratio, status
   ```

2. **Enhanced Connection Routing**:
   - Implement sophisticated pathfinding for cleaner line routing
   - Add support for multiple connections between bus pairs

3. **Geographical Positioning**:
   - Optional GPS coordinate support for geographical accuracy
   - Fallback to algorithmic layout when coordinates unavailable

4. **Additional Visual Elements**:
   - Line loading color coding
   - Voltage level indication
   - Power flow direction arrows

## Conclusion
The GridState-based SLD successfully bridges the gap between the original PSS®E-specific implementation and the need for universal backend support. While it lacks some advanced features of the original, it provides a solid foundation that works with WEC-GRID's unified data architecture and can be enhanced incrementally.
